'''
For this challenge, you will need to parse data from STDIN to find a character in a matrix. Below is an example of the input you will receive from STDIN:
 
[2, 4]
AFKPU
BGLQV
CHMRW
DINSX
EJOTY
 
The first line is the [X, Y] coordinates of the character in the matrix ([0, 0] is the bottom left character).â€¨The remaining lines contain a matrix of random characters, with a character located at the coordinates from line 1.
So, in the example above, we're looking for a character at the coordinates [2, 4]. Moving right 2 spaces, and up 4, we find the character K. So, K is the character.
 
Please write a program that reads from STDIN and prints the answer to STDOUT. Use the "Run Tests" button to check your solution against the test cases.
